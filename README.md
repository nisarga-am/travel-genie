# Travel Genie ✈️

Planning trips is a pain. You know it, I know it. So I built something better.

## What is this?

Travel Genie is a travel planning app where the UI actually understands what you need based on the conversation, not just dumb keyword matching.

Ask "where should I eat?" while you're planning → you get city guides  
Ask the same thing when you're already there → you get nearby restaurants  
Ask after your trip → you get your spending breakdown  

Same question, totally different answers. That's the whole point.

## Why I built this

I travel a lot for hackathons and conferences. Every single time, I'm juggling:
- Google Flights (finding tickets)
- Booking.com (hotels)
- Reddit threads (actual advice from humans)
- TripAdvisor (restaurants)
- Random blogs (things to do)
- 15+ browser tabs

Then I tried using AI chatbots. They either give you walls of boring text, or they spam every UI component they have without thinking.

So I thought: what if the AI actually *understood* where you are in your journey?

That's Travel Genie.

---

## Cool stuff it does

### 1. The UI changes based on context

This is my favorite part. Ask "where should I eat?" at different times:

**Planning phase:** Shows destination explorer  
**During trip:** Shows nearby restaurants  
**After trip:** Shows your food expenses  

It's the same question, but the AI knows what you actually need based on the conversation.

### 2. Dynamic backgrounds

Type any destination and the whole app transforms:

- **Karnataka** → Mysore Palace background, orange/amber vibes, temple emojis 🕌
- **Tokyo** → Neon Shibuya at night, pink/purple theme, cherry blossoms 🌸
- **Bali** → Rice terraces, emerald green, tropical paradise 🏝️

It's not hardcoded. The AI figures out what each place "feels like" and generates the theme on the fly using the Pexels API.

### 3. Emergency mode

Type "I lost my passport" anywhere in the app and it instantly shows:
- Embassy phone numbers
- Recovery steps
- Local police contacts

Because when you're freaking out in a foreign country, you don't want to navigate menus.

### 4. Smart conversations

Most chatbots either spam components or give boring text. Mine knows the difference:
```
"Any tips for Karnataka?" → helpful answer (no random UI)
"Show me hotels" → beautiful hotel cards
"I need flights AND hotels" → both components at once
```

### 5. AI generates unique itineraries

Not templates. Every itinerary is actually generated by AI:
- Day-by-day breakdown
- Morning, afternoon, evening activities
- Actual costs for each activity
- Budget pie charts
- Travel style optimization

I spent way too much time making sure each day is completely different. No repeated activities.

## The tech stuff

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Framer Motion for animations
- Recharts for graphs

**AI stuff:**
- Tambo AI SDK (the smart UI switching)
- Groq's Llama 3.3 70B (the brain)
- Pexels API (destination images)

**Deployment:**
- Vercel (it just works)

I built 21 different components from scratch. Each one has a detailed description that teaches the AI when to use it.

---

## Running it locally

You'll need Node.js 20+ installed.
```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/travel-genie.git
cd travel-genie

# Install stuff
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Create a .env.local file with:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_key_here  # optional but recommended

# Run it
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Getting API keys

**Groq (required):**
1. Go to [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Sign up (free)
3. Get your API key

**Pexels (optional but cool):**
1. Go to [pexels.com/api](https://www.pexels.com/api/)
2. Sign up (free, no credit card)
3. Get your API key
4. This powers the dynamic backgrounds

---

## How it actually works

Here's the flow:

1. You type something: "Find me hotels in Bangalore"
2. Goes to my API route
3. Groq AI reads it and looks at my component descriptions
4. Groq decides: "Okay, they want the HotelFinder component"
5. Groq figures out the props from the conversation (destination, dates, etc.)
6. Tambo validates everything
7. You see the UI

The magic is in the component descriptions. Each one is basically a prompt that teaches the AI when to use it.

Example:
```typescript
{
  name: "SmartItineraryPlanner",
  description: "Use ONLY when user provides budget, days, AND destination. 
               Example: 'I have $2000 for 7 days in Tokyo'
               Don't use for general questions about places."
}
```

### Context awareness

Tambo tracks the last 5 messages. So if you say:
1. "I want to visit Karnataka for 5 days with ₹10,000"
2. "Show me hotels"

The AI knows you mean Karnataka hotels. It doesn't ask again.

## Things to try

Type these in the chat:

**Planning:**
- "I have ₹10,000 for 5 days in Karnataka"
- "When's the best time to visit Bali?"
- "Do I need a visa for Japan?"

**Booking:**
- "Show me hotels in Bangalore"
- "Find flights from Delhi to Mumbai"

**During trip:**
- "Where should I eat breakfast?"
- "What's the weather like?"
- "I lost my passport!" (tests emergency mode)

**General:**
- "Any safety tips?"
- "Best restaurants in Karnataka?"

---

## Known issues

**Slow sometimes:**  
Groq's free tier has rate limits. If it's slow, that's why.

**Images don't load:**  
Make sure you have the Pexels API key in `.env.local`

**Components look broken:**  
Check browser console (F12). Usually missing props.

---

## What I learned

Building this taught me that Tambo isn't just a UI library. It's a completely different way of thinking about interfaces.

Instead of "if user clicks button X, show page Y" it's "if user seems to need X based on everything I know, show it."

That's powerful.

The hardest part was teaching the AI when NOT to show UI. Most chatbots spam components. Getting it to know when to just... talk normally took a lot of prompt engineering.

Also, making 21 components mobile-responsive is not fun. But it works.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add something cool?

1. Open an issue first so we can discuss
2. Fork it
3. Make your changes
4. Test it properly (especially on mobile)
5. Send a PR

I'm pretty chill about contributions. Just keep the code clean and add comments if you're doing something weird.

## Built for a hackathon

This was built for WeMakeDevs "Hack All February" - Week 1: The UI Strikes Back.

**Why I think it has a shot:**  
- Actually solves a real problem I have
- 21 components (most comprehensive in the hackathon probably)
- Context-aware UI morphing (unique feature)
- Production-ready (error handling, mobile, etc.)
- Cool emergency detection feature

We'll see how it goes.

---

## License

MIT - do whatever you want with it. Just don't blame me if something breaks.

---

## One more thing

If this helped you or you think it's cool, give it a star ⭐

It helps with the hackathon and honestly just makes me happy.

Thanks for checking it out!
